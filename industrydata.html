Out of all the skills required by these jobs, there is a particular set of skills common to each job that are desired by employers. The analytics software company Burning Glass Technology(BGT) lists the most desired skills by employers both in IT and in general. 

 

In 2017-18, BGT looked at 121,997 job listings for General Skills, 27,435 listings for IT skills and 120,353 listings for IT job titles. From this data, BGT determined the most in demand; 

General skills 

IT skills 

IT job titles 

 

The top 3 most in demand IT skills listed are; 

 

.SQL 

 Java  

JavaScript 

 

All of these skills were listed as one of the most important skills in each of the jobs desired by the group. This adds merit to the data supplied by BGT. 

 

In addition Github and several programming languages such as Python and HTML are other skills common to each job. In general, communication and creativity are desirable skills for each job. These skills rank very high in the BGT data. 

 

Based on the BGT data and the skill requirements for each of the jobs, a shortlist of skills most important to the group has been created. These are ranked from most important to least important. 

 

IT 

SQL. Ranked the most desired IT skill by employers according to BGT  data 

Java. Ranked 2nd most desired IT skill by employers according to BGT data 

JavaScript. Ranked 3rd most desired IT skill by employers according to BGT data 

Python. Ranked 22nd most in-demand skill. While this ranked in the lower end of the top jobs, the fact that all the desired jobs of the group require knowledge of the python programming language ensures its place on this list                                        

HTML. Doesn’t explicitly appear in the BGT data but it’s clear that any career in IT will involve some knowledge of HTML. This assessment requires it after all 

Git. e.g. Github/Git version control. Ranked 21st most in demand skill. It’s a cornerstone to this assessment and the jobs of most group members require them to know how to use it 

 

General 

Communication. Communication is by far the most desired skill according to BGT data. With over 44,000 of the 122,000 jobs listed, one third of IT jobs listed communication is a required or desired skill for job candidates. Communication is listed more than twice as much as the next ranked skill, Problem Solving. 

Creativity. As the group mostly chose careers as developers, creativity will be a key skill. 

Teamwork. This isn’t explicitly listed in the BGT data, however it’s clear that the ability to work in a team is crucial for success in the workplace. 

Problem Solving. Ranked 2nd in the BGT General skills data. Data Scientists identify patterns and trends in data to solve real world problems. 

 

 

Notable skills in the BGL data not listed in the group's jobs

Initially, my ideal career was as a data scientist however my ideal job title was as an anti-cheating specialist at Jagex. A slightly different field to my ideal career. However, my ideal job title is now a Data Scientist at Jagex after a position opened up. 

After analysing the data, I still maintain a desire to become a data scientist at Jagex. However, I now have a greater appreciation for the requirements of the specific job and the field in general. The fact that the job listing requires SQL and communication which are the most desired skills in IT and general respectively has helped me to understand their relevance in the job and the field of data science in general.
