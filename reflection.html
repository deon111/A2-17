    <p>The team had several qualities and traits which allowed us to collaborate effectively. Group members were extremely respectful, polite and empathetic, which assisted us in critical decision making, problem solving and organising. This behaviour was demonstrated by not active listening, effective questioning and informing the team of issues before the issue became critical. This is evident in our meetings, posts and instant messages’. </p>

    <p>I believe the group could improve by responding to messages and posts quicker, as this has caused several delays. A consequence of slow communication caused us to reschedule our first meeting, which if held sooner, would have granted us more time to complete this assessment.  </p>
    <p>My initial impression of online group work was dauting as I believed it will be difficult to organise and plan effectively, however Microsoft Teams has been extremely effective and allowed us to collaborate well.  </p>
    <p>Furthermore, in previous group assessments there were unnecessary delays caused by conflict. However, this has not happened in this group and I am thankful for it. I credit this towards everyone being respectful and empathetic.  </p>
    <p>I’ve learned several things from working in this group. Firstly, it’s important to choose group members carefully, because it determines the quality of the content in the assessment. Particularly, I should consider how serious the group member is taking their studies, as this determines their level of contribution and efforts they exert.  </p>
    <p> have created the website and the user interface (UI), which required many updates, bug fixes and optimisations. The website UI was created earlier than the completion of the assessment content, hence why most of the commits on GitHub during the beginning of assessment 2 was by me. Furthermore, I created the meetings tab and formatted the website content to maintain a consistent visual experience for the reader. </p>

    <p>Of the group members that contributed to the Assignment, I think there was adequate communication between group members and each group member accepted their tasks wit grace and humility. We were respectful to each other and we were all willing to help out if particular group members were struggling. This allowed issues to be solved in a timely manner and ensured all group members were able to contribute effectively.
Furthermore, there was no internal conflict within the group which gave us the best opportunity to effectively complete work.

While I’m happy with how our group collaborated, there is room for improvement.
Communication. The group as a whole often were slow to responding to messages/posts. Also, because of problems with my PC, I was not able to attend one of the group meetings
Organisation. The group was slow to begin the assignment. As a consequence, we still had a little bit to do on the due date. Trying to rush assignment content under significant time stress can affect the quality.

The most surprising thing about this group assignment is openness of the group. For example, the group was able to openly discuss our individual marks from assignment one without judgement from the group.

One thing I’ve learned from working with the group is that informing the team about potential issues as soon as possible. Not being up front about your problems can significantly set back progress in the assignment.

I embedded the documents of one of the sections of the assignment and part of another into the website. This involving converting the documents to a PDF and uploading them to the Github.</p>
