For the IT Work section, we chose to interview an IT professional named Andrew Evans who works as UX/UI Designer for a company called JIBB. Using the questions provided, Prestige Worldwide team member Aden Stokes conducted the interview via email correspondence. Here is what he had to say about his life as an IT professional.
<hr><hr>

Aden: Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?

Andrew: I currently work as the Lead UX/UI Designer at a small tech startup called JIBB. My role includes managing the product design for our mobile app and website, as well as working closely with the development team to define product requirements and handover designs for them to implement.
<hr>
Aden: Please tell us about the industry you work in:

Andrew: The type of product I am working on is a new AI based app that is targeted towards education and business users. It’s an app that can detect writing surfaces using any smartphone camera, recognise and capture handwritten content and create a digital rendering of it in real time, to save on your phone or share via our webapp. The industry I work in is basically just technology/artificial intelligence. 
<hr>
Aden: What other kinds of work do you have to do?

Andrew: Within my role I am also responsible for designing marketing material, taking photos or videos to explain how the product works, as well as use JIRA to manage my daily tasks, and stay on track with deadlines.
<hr>
Aden: Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them:

Andrew: I mostly report to the Chief Operating Officer/Head of Product and the CTO of the company, who are both in charge of making sure the product is being developed properly and in line with my designs and the technical requirements. I also work closely with the internal testing team, who test each new release of the product, and report back to me with any bugs or errors with the functionality of UX, as well as anything else that might need attention. I also sometimes work with sales to give live online demos of our product to show potential new clients how it works or conduct user tests with them in order to get feedback on how we can improve our product.
<hr>
Aden: Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.

Andrew: In the past and within my current role, I have always worked closely alongside IT professionals, usually people who manage the internal tech infrastructure of the company I am working for, as well as a variety of programmers who have experience writing many different types of code, including JavaScript, Python, .Net, React and other full stack developers or front end developers who work mostly with HTML and CSS, and frameworks like Bootstrap. 
<hr>
Aden: What about your interactions with clients or investors?

Andrew: As a UX/UI designer, I often find myself working closely with the development team as well as with outside clients and investors, who want to be involved in defining the product they want or plan to invest in. In this process I have learnt about how to deal with their expectations, and how they might differ from programmers, who are often more logical and functionality focused, whereas outsides are normally more concerned with how it looks, or how to make money from a product.
<hr>
Aden: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.

Andrew: I usually spend most of my time working on wireframes and prototypes of designs for both the mobile app and webapp, which also means I do a lot of research and reading about similar problems that have been solved and look at common design trends and best practices. I then spend a lot of time applying feedback and making older designs even better.
<hr>
Aden: Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?

Andrew: Usually starting a new project or trying to solve a new problem that never existed is the biggest challenge, when you are trying to create something new, there’s not a lot of existing resources to tell you how to do it, so coming up with a technical solution to something before anyone else has is very hard, but also satisfying when you get something to look good, as well as function well too without any bugs. 
<hr>
Aden: Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
the IT industry?

Andrew: Over the years I have worked on many different products, but some of the biggest projects I worked on were for a company called InfoTrack, which is a SAAS (software as a service) provider, which sells online products and services to mostly the legal industry, and there I was able to make products that were built on new technology and see how good UX/design resulted in a better customer experience and more profit for the company. This outcome was only possible because I worked as part of a wider team, all  within the IT profession who were able to work really well together and let each person with their own set of IT skills shine, and streamlined the workflow. I have worked in other places where one or two people wanted to oversee everything, and there wasn’t a lot of streamlined workflow, which held everything up. The point I am making is, the essence of the IT industry relies on people all being good at something different, the world doesn’t need people with all the same skills, so finding where you fit in and a company that supports that is the best example of working well as an IT professional.
