    <p>Student Number: s3824202</p>
    <p>Background: Born and raised in Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Hobbies</p>
    <p>A recent hobby has been learning Python. I enjoy its simplicity and welcoming nature towards beginner programmers. As a side project, I made developed a web scraping application which collects data data from EPSN (sports website) and saves the information into an Excel file. I believe this project helped me understand the power of programming. Also, I enjoy going to the gym and playing sports.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Interest in IT</p>

    <p>My interest towards IT began as I played video games at a young age which developed curiosity about the creation and operations of these programs. Now, allot older, I am mostly drawn towards programming. I believe programs can automate and increase the quality of life towards its clients and furthermore, there are many high salary job opportunities in this industry.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">IT experience</p>
    <p>My programming skills are intermediate, and I am currently studying Python through Udemy courses.

    <p>My test results indicate high agreeableness and moderate conscientiousness.High agreeable people can postpone or delay immediate concerns with other group members and resultantly cause damage and escalate situations.  I am moderately conscientiousness, which is the tendency to be organised and dependable. If there is a large discrepancy between my conscientiousness and another group member, this can create frustration for both parties. Therefore, I believe it is important to understand our differences and attempt to solve issues as it begins, without delay and try our best.</p>

    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Mya Myintzu Thant</strong></p>
    <img src="mya.jpg" alt="..." class="rounded float-right">
    <p>Student Number: s3819438</p>
    <p>I am of Burmese ethnicity and am currently living in my home country, Myanmar. I am proficient in both Burmese and English. My highest level of educational achievement is that I completed the Taylors College University of Sydney Foundation Program. I was an international student in Sydney for four years while I completed my studies at Taylors College and then changed from a Medical Science degree to Science and then a Psychology one at the University of Sydney, but due to personal reasons, I dropped out. I went back to my home country and have worked in a logistics company for two years as a personal assistant and bookkeeper. It is a small company that specialises in container truck transportation so I take on a lot of tasks outside of my official job responsibilities like planning advertisements and managing the truck drivers. As a result, I have been able to learn more about how a logistics company runs.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Hobbies</p>
    <p>My hobbies include studying Mandarin, watching Netflix and reading educational books, fictional novels and webtoons.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Interest in IT</p>
    <p>I am interested in IT because it could be applied in all working industries and the job market for IT professionals have only been growing. Therefore, studying IT would be a huge advantage for me no matter which industry I later choose to work in. Moreover, I feel passionate about creating things useful to society. Information technology in particular have immensely aided society and most of the time, in a way that involves easy access to the population. My interest in IT began a decade ago with Facebook. I was interested in how influential and dangerous Facebook was and still is as a social platform. Although Facebook is a convenient place to connect with friends and family, many of my underaged friends were approached by very much older, potentially dangerous strangers on it. </p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">IT experience</p>
    <p>I do not have much experience with IT outside of adequately using social media, canvas, Netflix, search engines and smartphones. I chose to study IT at RMIT as it was an internationally recognized university that was fully available online, allowing me to have a high quality education in Myanmar. I expect to learn a few programming languages, how to design applications and about other areas of IT I am not accustomed to.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Team Profile</p>
    <p>Myers-Briggs Test Results: Advocate (INFJ-T, Introverted Intuitive Feeling Judging Turbulent)</p>
    <p>The advocate personality result accurately pinpointed my weakness of being a perfectionist, but finding routine tasks uninteresting. I will have to constantly make sure I finish all my daily tasks so that I do not stall my team‚Äôs work or lower my expectations depending on the context of the situation. I am more on the judging side so I prefer to be highly organized and prefer team mates that are the same as me. However, I am flexible so there is not much to worry if my team changes plans and I have to adapt to it. I am highly turbulent and sensitive so I might not react well if others make personal insults or speak harshly.</p>
    <p>Learning Style Test Results: Visual</p>
    <p>As I am a visual learner, I would encourage other members to explain using visual aids if possible. On my part too, I will try to organize information by using visual aids and write down anything relevant. This could be useful for other visual learners in my team.</p>
    <p>Creativity Test Results: 67.76 (Average is 63.08)</p>
    <p>Perspective seems to be one of my strong suits so I expect to be able to relate to my team members. This should help me to be more objective when listening to others‚Äô opinions and with my decision making abilities. I lack boldness so being with understanding and encouraging team members would be helpful for me when I present my ideas. I can be timid.</p>
