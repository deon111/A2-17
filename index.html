    <p>Background: Born and raised in Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Hobbies</p>
    <p>A recent hoby has been learning Python. I enjoy its simplicity and welcoming nature towards beginner programmers. As a side project, I made developed a web scraping application which collects data data from EPSN (sports website) and saves the information into an Excel file. I believe this project helped me understand the power of programming. Also, I enjoy going to the gym and playing sports.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Interest in IT</p>
    <img src="deontests.png" alt="..." class="rounded float-right">
    <p>My interest towards IT began as I played video games at a young age which developed curiosity about the creation and operations of these programs. Now, allot older, I am mostly drawn towards programming. I believe programs can automate and increase the quality of life towards its clients and furthermore, there are many high salary job opportunities in this industry.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">IT experience</p>
    <p>My programming skills are intermediate, and I am currently studying Python through Udemy courses. Furthermore, me and a friend are working on a project to create a business website from scratch. This would function as a busines opportunity, provide practical experience, and serve as work experience on our resume.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Team Profile</p>
    <p>My test results indicate high agreeableness and moderate conscientiousness.High agreeable people can postpone or delay immediate concerns with other group members and resultantly cause damage and escalate situations.  I am moderately conscientiousness, which is the tendency to be organised and dependable. If there is a large discrepancy between my conscientiousness and another group member, this can create frustration for both parties. Therefore, I believe it is important to understand our differences and attempt to solve issues as it begins, without delay and try our best.</p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Ideal Job: Software Programmer</p>

      <li>Software developers refers to a broad range of careers, however it usually refers to creating computer software and applications, they usually specialise in one or more fields such as web or database development. They defer from a data scientist, as a programmer is usually not involved in influencing objective business decision. A software developer usually have the knowledge to become a web developer.</li>
