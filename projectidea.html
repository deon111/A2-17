    <hr class="my-4">


    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Overview</strong></p>

    <p>This project will be an Android smartphone app that will provide effective communication with health professionals. It aims to provide an improved experience for patients to diagnose conditions and receive medication with the use of question prompt lists (QPLs).  </p>
    <p>QPLs are a structured list of questions a patient can ask a General Practitioner (GP) during a consultation. QPLs encourage patients to better plan their questions for a consultation. This will enable health professionals to better identify illnesses, administer medication and provide advice. Furthermore, this app is unique because, unlike other apps implementing QPLs, this app allows patients to edit the QPLs.  </p>
    <p>This app also features online consultations with GPs which can be used alongside the QPLs. The online consultations will be recorded which help keep health professionals legally accountable for their actions and advice. Resultantly, this will increase standards of service. </p>

    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
    <p>We have all experienced endless queues and awkward interactions with our local GPs and all these factors inhibit our ability to communicate effectively. Without good communication patients are unlikely to receive effective treatment.  </p>
    <p>The Medical Journal of Australia’s study, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.5694/mja2.50771">"Diagnostic error: incidence, impacts, causes and preventive strategies”</a>, published by clinicians, Professor Ian Scot and Professor Carmel Crock, found medical diagnostic errors of up to 140,000 annually, 21,000 cases of serious harm and 2000-4000 deaths. </p>
    <p>With QLPs and online consultations, we believe misdiagnoses can be reduced. As structured and meaningful questions help patients make informed decisions, remember more, cope better, adhere to medication better and recover quicker (Rodin, et al., 2009).  </p>
    <p>Online consultations minimise face-to-face interactions and can increase the quality of service and communication.  Research has shown that QPLs have increased the likelihood of patients asking difficult and/or important questions (Eggly, et al., 2014). Furthermore, recording consultations will help patients revise what happened during consultations and keep health professionals accountable for their behaviour or advice. </p>
    <p>For a case of medical negligence, the Civil Liability ACT Section 40 outlines what could reasonably be expected of a person professing that skill (medical practice in this instance). However, without clear evidence of wrongdoings, medical practitioners can defend vigorously, which makes it hard for patients to claim any compensation. The use of this app can provide clear cut evidence that can be used in legal matters, such as insurance claims. </p>
    <p>Moreover, Australia suffers the worst statistical rate of medical errors in the world, to resolve this, all interactions are online, which means they will be recorded for legal concerns. This holds the medical practitioner legally accountable for their actions. Additionally, it provides protection to medical practitioners as there is clear and concentre evidence. </p>


    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>The app can be used without an internet connection. Data will also be backed up when internet connection is available.  </p>
    <p>The home page will be simple and professional in appearance, with a white background and contrasting text. </p>
    <p>By selecting the “Next” button, the user can proceed to the next page, or select the help button to view tutorials detailing the functions of the app and an email address for additional support. </p>
    <p>For first time users, an account must be created which contains name, DOB, email address, and previous health conditions. </p>
    Miscellaneous: <ul>
      <li>Provide a user-friendly experience. </li>
      <li>Keep records of medicine purchases. </li>
      <li>Keep copies of health professional instructions or advice in PDF format. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead text-primary">The App </p>
    <p>Health professionals must be employed to help construct the QPL and prescribe medication. </p>
    <p>If patients require medication, they must first have a diagnosis of their condition/s. This can be done through an online consultation, similar to an appointment at a local GP. The GP will send a summary of the advice via email and to the in-app inbox after the consultation. </p>
    <p>All patients must verify their identity by providing official documentation such as such as drivers licence and passport. This is to safeguard the platform abuse and because certain medication require prescription. </p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Features </p>
    <p>A feature which differentiates this app from the currently available apps is the ability to edit the QPL. This means, the patient can edit the questions in the list to make it more relevant to their circumstances. </p>
    <p>The app allows editable QPLs and audio recording, camera and video recording features. The playback feature will be basic, with play/pause, rewind, forward features which will allow the patient to review their response.  </p>
    <p>There will be recording features for each QPL question that will allow patients to record the answer for that specific question. This will help the patients organise the content of their recordings and allow a more efficient way to find recorded information without having to go through the whole consultation recording. The date and time of each recording will also be recorded so that it can be used as evidence if the patient requires it for legal use. </p>
    <p>Moreover, there will be a video and voice recording feature placed above the QPL that patients can use for recording the whole consultation. Some patients might prefer this option. </p>
    <p>QPLs for specific diagnoses, treatments or consultation type may be available in the future and will be constructed following the advice of a medical practitioner.  Multiple QPLs can be stored and downloaded from the app and these can be organised according to the patient's preferences. This facilitates accurate record keeping of the patient’s previous health conditions’ and treatment. </p>
    <p>Communication between patients and GPs are recorded, this includes messages exchanged between the two parties and online consultations.  This will combat misdiagnoses and negligent behaviour by GPs. Furthermore, it may also as act as legal protection for GPs. </p>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Online Consultations </p>
    <p>Consultations with health professionals will support voice and video recordings. It will also include a feature that would allow the recording of the answer to each question in the QPL and a separate recording feature that records the entire consultation. </p>
    <p>The app will also record user activities such as consultation dates, purchases and medication instructions. </p>
    The app can be used to provide medication to: <ul>
      <li>Colds and Flu. </li>
      <li>Conjunctivitis ("pink eye “). </li>
      <li>Diarrhea. </li>
      <li>Headaches. </li>
      <li>Stomach Aches. </li>
      <li>Join pain medicine </li>
      <li>ect</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead text-primary">Recording  </p>
    <p>As stated in study by The Medical Journal of Australia (Diagnostic error: incidence, impacts, causes and preventive strategies), there are countless misdiagnoses occurring. To resolve this issue, we have implemented the recording of online consultations. This will keep health professionals accountable for their behaviour and it can also act a legal protection for them. </p>
    <p>Victims of medical malpractice can be entitled to compensation and this app provide evidence if a victim chose to take matters legally. </p>

    <p class="lead text-primary">Examples of QPL </p>
    <p>An injury to a ligament in the knee: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Which ligament is injured? </li>
      <li>What are the short and long-term effects of alcohol? </li>
      <li>What’s the best treatment available?</li>
      <li>Is surgery required?</li>
      <li>Will surgery improve my quality of life?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The QLP ends here, however the patient can edit the QPL and include voice recordings, pictures and videos, to include more information, such as: </p>
    <p>Question 5. The patient includes a voice message describing their current lifestyle, to provide the GP more detail so the GP can provide a more accurate answer. </p>
    <p>Question 6.   The patient adds a question: What’s the cost of surgery? I do not have Private Health Insurance.  </p>

    <p class="lead text-primary">Diagnosis and Treatment (response from GP): </p>
    <p>Further clarification is required to complete this diagnosis and consider treatment options.  Please see attached referral to get an MRI scan. Please contact me if you require more information. </p>
    Possible condition: <ul>
      <li>Damage ligament/s in the knee. </li>
      <li>Torn quadricep, surrounding muscles or tissue. </li>
    </ul>

      Pain relief: <ul>
      <li>You may take anti-inflammatory medicine. </li>
      <li>Pain Killers if necessary, very 8 hours. </li>
    </ul>These medications are available for purchase below.

    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></p>
    <img src="androidstudio.png" alt="..." class="rounded float-right">
    <p>This will be a smart phone app for Android devices; therefore, Android studio will be chosen to develop this app. Android Studio uses the Java programming language and the app protype will be developed from this.  Coding the program can be simplified by importing external Java libraries.  </p>

    <ul>Below is list of open source Java libraries, which will fast track the development of this app.
      <li><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder">MediaRecorder</a> - captures audio from device microphone and saves it.   </li>
        <li><a href="https://javaee.github.io/javamail/">JavaMail </a> - send and receive email.  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>GitHub, a code hosting platform for collaboration, team task management and version control.  </p>
    <p>Microsoft teams, a communication platform for the team to plan, work and communicate effectively online. A memory stick as a backup hard drive storage for the app’s codes.  </p>

    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Skills Required</strong></p>
    <p>Knowledge and experience with several programming likes such as HTML and Java are required for the creation of this app. Furthermore, familiarities with external Java libraries will be extremely beneficial. However, this knowledge can be gained from educational websites such as Udemy and Skillshare.  </p>
    <p>I believe a protype of this app is feasible, features such as: GUI and login screen, create and save QPL, save pictures and emails will be easy to implement. However, difficult features will include online consultations and online booking.  </p>
    <p>Furthermore, effective communication, time management and conflict management skills will further benefit the team for developing this app.   </p>


    <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>As discussed above, we believe there are too many misdiagnoses happening around the world. The ideal outcome, if this project is successful, is to reduced cases of misdiagnoses and to provide a streamlined and improved platform for medical treatment. We believe, with editable QPLs and online consultations this is possible.  </p>
    <p>The QPLs will function as a reminder for the questions they should ask in a consultation and the recorded online consultations will help patients remember their advice and reduce negligent behaviour of health professionals. Overall, the patients will feel empowered to ask necessary questions and feel confident in the treatment they receive. </p>
